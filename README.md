# psumac2023
Resources for PSU MacAdmins 2023 Conference talk.

Thank you for your interest in ITS-LOG!  The one-click log collector and user issue reporting tool for busy admins.

Please read the **[RUNBOOK](https://github.com/bradtchapman/psumac2023/blob/main/runbook.md)** for step-by-step instructions.

The 'aws' and 'script' folder contain the required code, and some example Amazon policies for use.  The 'extras' folder contains sound effects (invoked with 'afplay') and a couple of icons, if you want them.  Feel free to supply your own graphics and sounds (or not).
